How I want to live as a CS professional
This blog post is intended to argument why I want to join the Toptal Software Engineers Group. For this purpose, I think the best way is to write about my relationship with programming and CS, and how is it that I want to live doing what I love.

I've known for a long time that I want to work in the computer science area, I've always been fascinated about it, the things you can do and how you can create awesome things out of nothing but pure knowledge. 

I'm amazed at what the open source community has built. And this central to the plot, the open source community allows us to stand on the shoulders of a giant when starting a project. It allows little companies to raise from nothing and offer solutions that are used by millions. This is the living proof that working remotely is possible, now there's no need for a big office to gather a lot a people working together, and there's no need for lots bosses and hierarchy to coordinate talented people's work and allow them to do awesome things, the proof is there, in the millions of lines of code that have been written by open source contributors. I think this new scheme is taking humanity to a better place, more collaborative and emphatic, I believe that those huge old companies with huge buildings and lots of bosses and managers are becoming extinct, not unlike huge dinosaurs. I'm very optimistic about the future, and I think that the way we are building software today is the seed of the way people will collaborate with each other to solve mankind hardest problems.

## Working as an artist ## 
I finished college a short time ago, and by now it's been 8 years since I wrote my first line of code (in Pascal), but then I never stopped, my ambition in life is to become really, really, really good at solving problems using computers. 

When I was 15 years old I wanted to study music, but then, when I discovered programming fell immediately in love with it, I quickly changed my career goal to Computer Science, this was easy because music felt much more like a hobby, while CS felt much more like a Job. After that, I never regretted this decision and never felt forced to learn any of the CS topics, instead, I've always done it gladly.

However, now that I started to work full time, my spare time shrunk substantially. There are two things that I love to do in my spare time, the first is working on my personal software project (most of the time I have one, sometimes for learning purposes, sometimes solving a specific need), and the second is playing the piano. 

The thing is, with less spare time I started to worry a lot about my own productivity for both writing software, and improving as a musician. In this process, I started to realize that my productivity as a programmer has a close relationship with my mental state, just as much playing piano does. I realized that I write better code, faster, and make fewer mistakes when my head is clear and I feel in peace, calm, unangry and happy. 

This discovering made me see clearly what I want in my life: I want to live as an artist, I want to enjoy the art of programming, of solving problems by thinking, just like I enjoy playing a musical piece from start to end after months of practice, but I want to choose the way to do it, I want to choose the projects in which I work, because I know that I'll get the best out of myself by being motivated. Working remotely and self-organized seems like the way to do it, solving problems does not feel like sitting on the computer and write a lot of code, but it's understanding needs, processes, and people, the coding part is little compared with the thinking and designing part.

I don't need to be all day long in an office to solve a problem, I need a quiet place to understand it, and time to think about it. When I was training for the ICPC competition in college, training sessions were every Friday from 14:00 to 18:30, after that, most of the times I went home with an unsolved problem, usually the hardest of the session, and sometimes only after 2 or 3 days I found the solution, but it wasn't by looking at the code on the screen, I usually found the answer while taking a shower or eating or doing anything else. "Let your brain do the work", said out Logic for CS professor a couple of times.

So, what do I want? I want to work, a lot, but in my own way, I want time to think and to solve problems, I want to find other people who love this as much as I do and work with them, I trust myself and know I can do great things, all I need is the freedom of a work like this.
